# ez-sporting-event-capture

Automated capture and processing of sporting events.

This project was started Dec 2020.  Interested?  Welcoming help planning & developing it.

Expected components:

1. capture
2. processing
3. viewing (basic viewing, annotating, analysis)

For now, success means to me being able to:
 - capture a soccer game without any human intervention (stationary camera, whole-field-capture, at high resolution, from good height above the field, possibly with fish-eye lens)
 - the processing step figures out what subregion of the video to show over time and handles correcting any lens distorition
 - watching the processed video is like watching a professionally broadcast game

# Roadmap

 - one camera
   - how will camera be positioned to capture at least half the field?  (e.g., N-foot tripod w/ gopro mount)
   - how will region-of-interest over time be determined?
   - how will processing be done, given region-of-interest over time?

 - multiple cameras
   - how will cameras be synched?
   - how will multiple streams be merged or selected?

 - sharing
 - ..
