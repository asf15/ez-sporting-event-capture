# ez-sporting-event-capture

Automated capture and processing of sporting events.

This project was started Dec 2020.  Interested?  Welcoming help planning & developing it.

Expected components:

1. capture
2. processing
3. viewing (basic viewing, annotating, analysis)

For now, success means to me being able to:
 - capture a soccer game without any human intervention (stationary camera, whole-field-capture, at high resolution, from good height above the field, possibly with fish-eye lens)
 - the processing step figures out what subregion of the video to show over time and handles correcting any lens distorition
 - watching the processed video is like watching a professionally broadcast game
